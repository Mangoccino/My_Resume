        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p>Welcome to my resume, this is my first official website. 
        <br>I am currently a CT radiographer specialising in cardiac scanning. I have a keen interest in web development and data science, and I am looking for a job in the industry. </p>
        
        <h3>Why didn't I do a bachelors?</h3>
        <p>I am a New Zealand Citizen, and have no access to HECS HELP in Australia, this means that I have to pay all my tuition fees upfront. Because of this, I wanted to do a course that could give me good basic knowledge into the industry and work on my own to continue. I would be open to doing further studies if required.
