        <h2> Work experience </h2>
            <h3> Overview </h3>
            <p> Being in healtcare has allowed me to learn to interact with all types of people and build my skills. I can communicate effectively with people of all levels, it has also made me a good listener of peoples' problems, and I thrive to ask all the questions to gather crucial information to solve the problem. The job has also trained me to work calmly under pressure, both alone and in a team environment and prioritise important tasks. <br><br>
            I also had the pleasure of managing a radiology clinic to hone my leadership skills, and we often had students coming through the site, which required good attention to details to teach the students.
