        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p> Welcome to my resume This page is still a work in progress, but it is on display to show what I can achieve.
        <br> I have three years of working experience in healthcare, and I am looking for a transition into an IT job. My keen interests are in web development and data analytics and visualisation.
        <br> I recently graduated from a Graduate Certificate in IT, however due to not being an Australian Citizen, it is hard for me to work and pay for further education. So I had decided to self learn using the Odin Project, Leetcode and other online resources, and hopefully I could land a job in the industry!
        <br> I am always open to learning and improvement and will be happy to do further education as required/desired. </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "section two">
        <h2> Education </h2>

        <h3> Overview </h3>
        <p> I have thouroughly enjoyed my recent course, Graduate Certificate in IT. I had learnt basic database management and queries, data analysis with Python and some packages, business analysis techniques and object oriented programming with Java. I am ready to start my career in IT, and work my way and learn as much as I can. </p>

        <h3> Why did I do a Graduate Certificate? </h3>
        <p> As a New Zealand Citizen and not Australian Citizen, I have no access to HECS HELP, so therefore I was only able to afford a short subsidised course. However, I am making the most of the resources available to me online, to be able to further my skills and interest. </p>

            <h2> Work experience </h2>
                <p> Being in healtcare has allowed me to learn to interact with all types of people and build my skills. I can communicate effectively with people of all levels, it has also made me a good listener of peoples' problems, and I thrive to ask all the questions to gather crucial information to solve the problem. The job has also trained me to work calmly under pressure, both alone and in a team environment and prioritise important tasks. <br><br>
                I also had the pleasure of managing a radiology clinic to hone my leadership skills, and we often had students coming through the site, which required good attention to details to teach the students.
