This document contains notes for html, CSS and javascript.

HTML stands for hypertext markup language

* boiler plate

    <!DOCTYPE html> //html current version 5.
    <html lang="en"> //helps with accessibility

    <head> //meta information that is NOT DISPLAYED.
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> //enable special symbols
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> 
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Main</title> //tab name

        //to link css
        <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "style.css">

        //to link javascript
        <script src="javascript.js"></script>
    </head>

    * using ! on first line in VS code gives a default boilerplate.

HTML basics:

* opening and closing tags
* headings 1-6 <h1>
* strong <strong>
* emphasis <em>
* comments <!-- -->
* <ul> and <ol> lists and list items <li>
* links <a href = "url"> " " </a>
    absolute links: links to the internet
    relative links: links in files, not including domain name
* images <img src = "path" alt = "missing"> //no end tag

CSS basics:
* Selectors:
    - * for universal
    - type such as <p> <h1>
    - class such as <div class = "header">, .header { //css code }
    - id such as <div id = "header">, #header { //css code }

* combining style:
    .header, .main {
        //css code
    }
* chaining style:
    .subsection.header {
        //css code 
        //this chains any element with subsection and header classes. no space required.
    }
* parent child:
    .parent .child {
        //css code
        //only selects child elements that are nested under parent.
    }

Styles basics:
* color: background-color: 
* font-family: font-size:
* height: width:
* border: solid color thickness; //this helps with seeing box method

* padding: space between words and textbox
* margin: space between textbox and textbox
* border: space between margin and padding

* <div> are blocks
* <span> are inline

Flexbox basics:
* parent_container {
    display: flex; //default to columns (left to right)
}
* child_container {
    flex: 1; //flex one portion
}
* second_child_container {
    flex: 2; //this container will have double the portion of the first container.
}
* flex: grow, shrink, basis
* flex-shrink: default is one, everying shrinks evenly, but higher numbers will shrink more than others.
* flex-basis: sets initial size of flex item, "auto" will check for any width declaration.
